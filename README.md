## What I Learned

Throughout the development of Camp Heaven, I gained valuable experience in:

- Building a full-stack application using React and Node.js.
- Handling complex state management and component communication in React.
- Creating secure authentication flows with Passport and managing tokens.
- Designing responsive layouts and custom components using Sass.
- Integrating third-party services like Stripe for payment processing.
- Managing a MySQL database with Knex.js for migrations and queries.

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements for future iterations include:

- Adding advanced filtering options for camps based on user preferences and location.
- Implementing social logins and enhancing the overall user authentication flow.
- Expanding the gear management feature to include automatic gear checklists for trips.
- Integrating a user messaging system for direct communication with camp administrators.
